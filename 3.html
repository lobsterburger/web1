<h2>Javacoffee</h2>
<p> “Java” Comes from the Island of Java
During the 1600s, the Dutch introduced coffee to Southeast Asia. They brought coffee trees to places like Bali and Sumatra, where it’s still grown today. Another island they began planting coffee on was Java, and it’s from this island that the name “java” arose.</p>
