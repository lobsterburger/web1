<p>Hello my friend :) i am happy to announce that i finally decide and launch my brand <a href="https://thekellystudio.com/" target="_blank" title="the kelly studio by beautiful Kelly">‘The Kelly Studio’</a>.
While working in SG based company, I got so many questions on my clothes and makeups from my Singapore and Malaysia friends. I really liked to share items that make life more beautiful and also comfortable with my friends.
I am mother of 2 baby girls so i do not want to set the limit age or lifestyle(whether you are housewife or office woman) range when i introduce products.</p>
<img src="class.jpg" width="100%">
<p style ="margin-top:50px"> I want to share the product that can be used over all generations possible.
I want to be ur best Korean friend who share latest Korea fashion style and beauty items for my Singapore and Malaysia friends. I really like to select product communicating with u all. Feel free to suggest items that u want and give me any opinions.
Event also will come with it so keep eye on my insta feed :)
Your friend Kelly</p>
